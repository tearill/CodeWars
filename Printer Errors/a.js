// The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

// Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

// You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

// The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

// #Examples:

// s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
// error_printer(s) => "0/14"

// s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
// error_printer(s) => "8/22"
function printerError(s) {
    // your code
    let len = s.length; 
    let count = (s.match(/[abcdefghijklm]/ig)||[]).length;
    return `${len-count}/${len}`;
}
console.log(printerError("aaabbbbhaijjjm"));
